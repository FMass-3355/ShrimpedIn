This is the Jumbo Shrimpers project for CSC330-01

Its backend utilizes Python, along with MySQL to allow a user to be created in either the student, teacher, or recruiter role. Once logged in, you will be greeted by a homepage that has some basic information on job seeking and what you usually need.

At the profile page, the user is able to edit their bio and information, as well as providing a resume to allow possible recruiters to view their profile and get an understanding of who they are.

The job posting page is where the students looking for a job go, where they input a keyword for the job, such as "software developer" and the location they wish to work in. If there is a job posting currently fitting those requirements, then a list will show up, allowing them to send their resume over for viewing to the recruiter.

The job portal is for the recruiter role, where they are able to view their current job postings, as well as view applicants and accept/deny them, open up new job postings, or close old ones.

The user control panel is for the admin role, where they are able to control users and job postings, deleting or editing them as they deem necessary.
